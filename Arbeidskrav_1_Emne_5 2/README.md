<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>I have chosen to "challenge" myself a little with going back
to code the program in Python. It's just a simple console-
program, where I have added PrettyTable to get a slighty better
print in console. Nothing advanced really, I have made the 
functions asked for where one can sort contacts in any way
wanted. We can display single contact, or all of them and finally
we can search within contacts and show everyone that fits the
criteria (searches all the properties).</p>
